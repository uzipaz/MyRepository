# A*

A* is my favourite algorithm of all time. It is basically Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm with an added interesting element 'Heuristic'. Heuristics are custom measurements between two points in a problem that we can use to alter how the algorithm will go about finding the solution within that problem. For example, Euclidean distance or simply put straight line distance between two points is the most commonly used heuristic in Path-finding problems.
